        <h4>About Soma</h4>
        <p>
            The protagonist of Shokugeki no Soma, Soma, grew up watching his father prepare meals in their small eatery,
            Shukujidokoro Yukihira. He improved his cooking skills while attending Totsuki Culinary Academy. His
            motivation is to outcompete his father, "Yukihira Joichiro," in a culinary fight by becoming one of the best
            chefs.

        <h4>Character</h4>
        <p>
            a sharp young man who is constantly striving to elevate his culinary skills. He still prepares food in
            various styles, such as French, Asian, and Indian. From his errors, he gains knowledge. He is self-assured
            in his abilities and constantly looks to test the boundaries of his cooking by challenging others to
            compete. Additionally adaptable and creative, Soma can bypass standard operating procedures to prepare
            meals, enabling him to come up with his own solutions when he wants to gain an advantage. He likes to play
            around with food and come up with weird recipes. He is an example of a prominent figure who possesses the
            traits that are common. <br>

            He's daring and even reckless. He demonstrates that despite having the greatest disadvantages, he is more
            than capable of overcoming the toughest obstacles. Soma is not scared to acknowledge that his opponent is
            superior to him at that very moment and that he is imperfect, but he keeps fighting. characteristics of
            Joichiro. His courage, which enables him to courageously face whoever opposes him, no matter how much of a
            genius they are or whatever disadvantages they may throw at him, gives him strength rather than innate
            cooking talent. Despite the fact that many of his classmates disliked him—primarily because he was arrogant
            during his admission speech—they were not all unfriendly.
